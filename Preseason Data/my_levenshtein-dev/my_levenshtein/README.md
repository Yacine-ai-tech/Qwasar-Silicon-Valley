# Welcome to My Levenshtein
thanks you so much it was a excited discovery.

## Tasks
the problem i encountered was about iterating the two strings and adding 0 at each time there is a difference between them.

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
 I did some researches on google about the levenshtein distance and also i tried to  understand the mathematical implication of Levenshtein distance.

## Installation
i think installing project is about the way to send it to qwarsa servers. If so , we have to git add, git commit -m"message" , git push.

## Usage
it works as wished . And it is so amazing.
